You are given an integer n.

Return the largest prime number less than or equal to n that can be expressed as the sum of one or more consecutive prime numbers starting from 2. If no such number exists, return 0.

 
Example 1:


Input: n = 20

Output: 17

Explanation:

The prime numbers less than or equal to n = 20 which are consecutive prime sums are:


	
	2 = 2
	
	
	5 = 2 + 3
	
	
	17 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7
	


The largest is 17, so it is the answer.


Example 2:


Input: n = 2

Output: 2

Explanation:

The only consecutive prime sum less than or equal to 2 is 2 itself.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= n <= 5 * 105
