You are given a positive integer n and an integer target.

Return the lexicographically smallest array of integers of size n such that:


	The sum of its elements equals target.
	The absolute values of its elements form a permutation of size n.


If no such array exists, return an empty array.

A permutation of size n is a rearrangement of integers 1, 2, ..., n.

 
Example 1:


Input: n = 3, target = 0

Output: [-3,1,2]

Explanation:

The arrays that sum to 0 and whose absolute values form a permutation of size 3 are:


	[-3, 1, 2]
	[-3, 2, 1]
	[-2, -1, 3]
	[-2, 3, -1]
	[-1, -2, 3]
	[-1, 3, -2]
	[1, -3, 2]
	[1, 2, -3]
	[2, -3, 1]
	[2, 1, -3]
	[3, -2, -1]
	[3, -1, -2]


The lexicographically smallest one is [-3, 1, 2].


Example 2:


Input: n = 1, target = 10000000000

Output: []

Explanation:

There are no arrays that sum to 10000000000 and whose absolute values form a permutation of size 1. Therefore, the answer is [].


 
Constraints:


	1 <= n <= 105
	-1010 <= target <= 1010
