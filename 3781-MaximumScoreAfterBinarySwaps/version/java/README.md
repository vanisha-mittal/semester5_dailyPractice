You are given an integer array nums of length n and a binary string s of the same length.

Initially, your score is 0. Each index i where s[i] = '1' contributes nums[i] to the score.

You may perform any number of operations (including zero). In one operation, you may choose an index i such that 0 <= i < n - 1, where s[i] = '0', and s[i + 1] = '1', and swap these two characters.

Return an integer denoting the maximum possible score you can achieve.

 
Example 1:


Input: nums = [2,1,5,2,3], s = "01010"

Output: 7

Explanation:

We can perform the following swaps:


	Swap at index i = 0: "01010" changes to "10010"
	Swap at index i = 2: "10010" changes to "10100"


Positions 0 and 2 contain '1', contributing nums[0] + nums[2] = 2 + 5 = 7. This is maximum score achievable.


Example 2:


Input: nums = [4,7,2,9], s = "0000"

Output: 0

Explanation:

There are no '1' characters in s, so no swaps can be performed. The score remains 0.


 
Constraints:


	n == nums.length == s.length
	1 <= n <= 105
	1 <= nums[i] <= 109
	s[i] is either '0' or '1'
